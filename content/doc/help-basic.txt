### Welcome to Style Spy! ###

## First Things First ##

# The first character of every line within the Style Spy dialog is significant.
# Every line must be entirely empty or begin with a special character.

# A line that starts with a "#" is a comment. This is a comment!
# Comments can only appear at the beginning of the file or immediately
# before a content line (described later).

# A line that begins with a "=" is a property line.
# The general format is "=name value".
# Everything after the first space is the property's value.
# The most important property is "language", and it must appear before content lines.
# It represents the language used in the Style Spy dialog, and the value
# matches Komodo's language names (e.g., "Python", "Tcl", "JavaScript").

# Only one language can be set in the Style Spy dialog -- so make it count!

=language JavaScript

# Ahh, there. Now we're using JavaScript styles throughout.

#####
# Try it yourself: Change the language above from JavaScript to Python.
# Did you notice the style change in these comments?
#####

# A line that starts with a "^" is a content line. These are the lines of text
# from the source file. Styles are applied to them and that's their entire purpose.

# A line that starts with a single space is a style line. There are two style
# lines immediately after every content line.

# All together they look something like this:

^var x = 0;
     1 1  1
 5..01000400

# The style lines describe the style of the content line above them.

#####
# Try it yourself: Change the 4 above to a 5.
# Did you notice the color change in the content line?
#####

# The numbers in the style lines are read from top to bottom:

# 1
# 2
# is the number 12.

#
# 4
# is the number 4. The blank is treated like a leading zero.

# The number below a content line character is that character's style.
# In the above example, the style for "v" (in "var") is the number 5.

# The "." simply means "the same as the number to my left". All characters
# in "var" above share the same style because the style is "5..".
# The dot style makes long lines easier to read.

# Finally, a trailing empty line is represented as a "$". No "$"
# at the end means the last line of the original content is not empty.
# Don't worry if it's missing (or if it's there!), just be aware that it's a thing.

## A Little Tab'll Do Ya ##

# There are three tabs available in the Style Spy dialog.
# Here is a brief description of each.

# The Source tab shows the raw content style data. The content can be modified,
# and, as mentioned above, content lines are updated with changes to styles.

# The Preview tab shows the content lines from the Source tab as if they
# were in a normal editor. This preview cannot be edited, but it is kept
# in sync with the Source tab.

#####
# Try it yourself: Make some changes to the content and style above,
# then click the preview tab. Huzzah!
#####

# The Swatch tab shows the available styles for the language being
# used in the Source tab. Its job is to make it easy to find the color
# you want when updating styles.

# That's Style Spy in a nutshell!
