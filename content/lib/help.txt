### Welcome to Style Spy! ###

#__First Things First__

#The first character in every line within the Style Spy dialog is significant.
#Every line must be entirely empty or begin with a special character.

#A line that starts with a "#" is a comment. This is a comment!
#Comments can only appear at the beginning of the file or immediately
#before a content line (described later).

#A line that begins with a "=" is a property line.
#The general format is "=name value".
#Everything after the first space is the property's value.
#The only meaningful property is "language". It represents the language
#used in the Style Spy dialog, and the value matches Komodo's language names
#(e.g., "Python", "Tcl", "JavaScript").
#Only one language can be set in Style Spy -- so make it count!

=language JavaScript

#Ahh, there. Now we're using JavaScript styles throughout.

#A line that starts with a "^" is a content line. These are the lines of text
#from the source file. Styles are applied to them and that's their entire purpose.

#A line that starts with a single space is a style line. There are two style
#lines immediately after every content line. All together they look something like this:

^var x = 0;
     1 1  1
 5..01000400

#The style lines describe the style of the content line above them.
#Want to see the content in a different style? Just change the style line!

#The numbers in the style lines are read from top to bottom:

# 1
# 2
# is the number 12.

#
# 4
# is the number 4. The blank is treated like a leading zero.

#The number below a content line character is that character's style.
#In the above example, the style for "v" (in "var") is the number 5.

#The "." simply means "the same as the number to my left". All characters
#in "var" above share the same style because the style is "5..".
#The dot style makes long lines easier to read.

#Finally, a trailing empty line is represented as a "$". No "$"
#at the end means the last line of the original content is not empty.
#Don't worry if it's missing (or if it's there!), just be aware that it's a thing.

#__From Komodo with Style__

#So you want to try some spying, eh? Well, chum, now is your chance!
#Open up a source file, open the Style Spy menu under Tools, then select
#"Copy Style to Dialog". Boom! You're spying!

#Not good enough for you? Tired of second-hand spy missions already?
#Well, crack open an empty Style Spy dialog and start spying *on nothing!*
#Simply open the Style Spy menu under Tools and select "Open New Dialog". Now
#you're not just a secret agent, you're a *free* secret agent!

#__The Programmer with the Golden Style__

#So what exactly can you do with Style Spy? You can spy on styles!
#Here are just a few of the few possible uses for Style Spy:
# * You can debug your UDL styles!
# * You can prototype a change that you'd like to see in Komodo...
# * Then take a screenshot for your enhancement request!
# * You can gussy up your style-related bug report with the Style Spy output!
# * Think you know your styles? Then quiz yourself on style numbers!
# * Tell a story using the stylized text, like "Peter and the Wolf" with colors!
# * Pretend the style lines are spaceships and have a space war!

^var x = 0; var y = function(z) {console.log(z);};
     1 1  1     1 1         111 11      11  111
 5..010004005..010005.......010001......01..010...0

#Whoa, look out! It's the Empire's superior forces on the left
#versus the Rebellion's wiley resistance on the right! Pew pew pew!

#__The Quantum of Style__

#Have a suggestion to improve Style Spy? Well, keep it to yourself! Ha!
#Or you can log an "issue" in GitHub: https://github.com/ervumlens/ko-stylespy
